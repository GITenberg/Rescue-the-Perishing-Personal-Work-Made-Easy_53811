A great many people think it is presumption for them to say they **know** they are saved—that they can only “hope for the best, and will have to wait until the judgment before they know.” Paul did not say to the jailer: “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and **perhaps** you will be saved, or you will have a **good chance** of being saved, or you may **hope** to be saved.” No, but “thou **shalt** be saved.”

“Put that in black and white," says the merchant when a good offer is made to him. God has put his offer in black and white—“**These things are written**.” Read: I John 5:13.

Do you say, I don’t feel it? Feeling is not the evidence, or proof for you to trust. Your feelings may change like the wind, but God’s word never changes. He says: “Heaven and earth shall pass away but My words **shall not** pass away.”

There are two extremes taken by people in the matter of baptism, one is to **reject** it entirely, and the other is to magnify it beyond it’s proper significance, and make it **necessary to salvation**.

We are to be baptized, not to **help save ourselves**, but, because **Christ has already saved us** through our acceptance of His sacrifice on the cross. We go forward in baptism in obedience to God’s command, thus openly confessing Him before the world by this act. Our baptism will avail us nothing, unless **our heart is right toward God**.

Christian Science. |nl| :sub:`Its NON-CHRISTIAN character.`
-----------------------------------------------------------

“Christian Science" is nothing new. It is a mixture of exploded theories and issues of the ancient world. Moreover, it is neither "Christian" nor “Science” for both the personality of Christ and matter are denied, and there could he no Christ without personality nor science without matter. This unscientific cult is not only not Christian but it denies many truths of the Bible.

**1st. A personal God.**

The belief that you have **no real body** enables you to dispose of the question of sin. If the body is only a phantom then sin would only be the phantom of a phantom; an easy way for a sinner to relieve himself of personal responsibility to God.

Personal Work. |nl| :sub:`Its Great IMPORTANCE.`
------------------------------------------------

THE importance of personal work we cannot over estimate. It is the method used by Jesus in His dealing with Nicodemus (John 3rd. Chap.), The Woman at the Well (John 4th chap.), The Man at the Pool (John 5th Chap. 18-19.). It was the method used by the Apostles and the early church. It is the work needed **now** if many souls are to be reached.

.. vspace:: 1

THIS is an age of heart-to-heart methods, woman to woman and man to man, reaching people in every line. The vast army of traveling salesmen used by business houses, illustrates this method while the wonderful agency system developed by the life insurance companies is a splendid example of success coming from **personal work** and **personal contact**.

.. vspace:: 1

THE **Holy Spirit** will convict men and women of sin, but he needs human help in reaching human hearts and inducing them to **act** after they are convicted. Most people whom you and I know are already convicted and convinced that they should be Christians. The great difficulty is to get them to **do it now** and this is **your part**.

.. vspace:: 1

IN this day of such great activity and “strenuous” living there are so many new things, as well as old, continually coming up that prevent people from desiring or even thinking of spiritual life. Never was it more true that we must **go out** into the **highways and compel them** to come in. In revivals too much is left to “general results,” until the "old general” is sadly overworked. **The motto of** that wonderful and effective organization of Christian business men, **the Gideons, is good for all Christians**: “And they stood **every man** in **his place** round about the camp."

Personal Work. |nl| :sub:`FRUIT-BEARERS Chapter.`
-------------------------------------------------

The fifteenth chapter of John, is the “fruit Chapter," likening Christ to the **vine**, and us to the **branches**; teaching us our need to abide in Christ, if we would bring forth fruit and have power.

1. I AM the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.
 
2. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that **beareth fruit**, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth **more fruit**.

Are you bearing fruit, and purged?

3. Now ye are **clean through the word** which **I** have spoken unto you.

The word cleanses the life, as the **knife** prunes the vine.

4. Abide in me, and I In you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye except ye abide in me.

Only as we abide in Christ, can we bear fruit.

5. I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: **for without me ye can do nothing**.

We can not do, **even a little** without Christ.

6. If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.

7. If ye abide in me, and my words **abide in you**, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.

Note the condition in asking, “if ye abide.”

8. Here in is my Father gloriﬁed, that ye bear **much fruit**; so shall ye **be my disciples**.    

.. class:: right antigua

In order to **bear fruit**, there must be in the Christian’s life:
       | 1st “**cleansing**” (vs. 2-3.);
       | 2nd “**abiding**.” (v. 4.);
       | 3rd "**obedience**" (v. 10.)

Bad habits are overcome by prayer; evil thoughts and tendencies are rooted out by prayer; dark hours are made light by prayer; midnight of prayer brings noonday and victory. “True prayer is the reflection of God’s thoughts back upon Himself, therefore to get God’s thoughts and pray in the spirit, I would pray over my Bible."

Revival, The. |nl| :sub:`How to make it a success.`
---------------------------------------------------

- Be a prayerful christian.
- Always be on time.
- Ask God to help you sing.
- Make it a point to attend every meeting.
- Do not quench the Spirit.
- Be ready to obey at God’s calling.
- When you come, look, as though you enjoyed the religion you profess.
- Shake hands as though it were not a dead fish tail but as if it were a pleasure.
- Always be prompt when others are slow in testifying.
- Watch for those who raise a hand and are convicted, and follow them up and lead them to Christ.
- Make it a point to invite your friends to attend the meeting, and accept Christ.
- When you come to the meeting, don’t find fault with the evangelist or the preacher’s methods. Ask yourself the question “if all the church members were like me, would this revival be a success?”
- Make it a business at the close of each meeting to speak to some one about seeking Christ.
- Always pray before the meeting and for your friends, that you may be able some way to lead them to Christ.

   `How to Hinder a Revival.`

- Never pray. If you did, it might help some one.
- Always make a long prayer.
- Then you come, be sure to take a back seat and stay there.
- If you do pray, pray at the evangelist and the people and not for them.
- Never bow your head when others are praying for if you did, they would think you might be interested.
- If you shake hands, do it as though it were an awful cross to you.
- Be sure that you keep account of what the preacher says and then rip him up the back.

3. Bring some matured thought on the theme—from your Bible study.
4. Bring the best illustration or application of the theme you have found in your reading or other research.
5. Bring some wish, aspiration, sense of need—sated appetites are the hardest to cater to.
6. Bring your attention: a wandering mind never wanders to God.
7. Bring your sympathies; give more than you expect to get, and you will get more than you expect.
8. Bring your smiles and cheerful looks and emphasize the **beauty** of holiness.

Scriptures, The. |nl| :sub:`How to memorize?`
---------------------------------------------

In preparing this book I trust that I have done something toward supplying a long-felt need among the Christians who desire to be soul winners.

.. vspace:: 1 

Looking at the great number of scripture references in this book it would seem like asking something that was impossible to suggest the memorizing of **all** these passages. Yet it is a comparatively easy task if undertaken in the right manner.

.. vspace:: 1 

In memorizing:

.. vspace:: 1 

**1st.** Memorize the difficulty then locate the verses under that difficulty and memorize the verses and where they are found. For example say John 1:29 “Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world” instead of merely saying “Behold the Lamb of God,” etc., omitting to say John 1:29.

.. vspace:: 1 

**2nd.** Learn it. Don’t get a faint, indefinite idea of it. **Take no “snap shot” but give it a “time exposure.”** If you want to remember any text in after years as well as at the present time, let it make a deep, clear, vivid impression on your mind.

.. vspace:: 1 

**3rd.** There are a great many “methods” or “schemes” of memorizing advanced in this day of ours, but the writer’s opinion is that the best way of memorizing is to **get to work and do it**. If it is easily acquired by some easy method, you may depend on it that **it will be as easily lost**.

.. vspace:: 1 

.. _org-page-117:

**4th.** Read the verses over twenty times, close your Bible, see if you can repeat it correctly, **then to be sure, read** it again. **I have made a practice of writing out on paper** the passages to be memorized. **Once writing the verse is worth a dozen repetitions of it by mouth**. In Joliet after talking on personal work one night a lady came to me and said “How did you memorize so many passages of scripture to meet the difficulties?” I said to her, “Did you ever ride on the train?” “Oh yes, hundreds of times." “Did you notice the brakeman come in and call out the station? How did he know it was the right station? He went over that road every day, and that is what you and I have to do.

.. vspace:: 1 

**5th. Review, Review, Review.** That’s the secret of memorizing. **Review** every **day**. **Review** every **week**. **Review** every **year**. **Review, Review, Review**.

.. vspace:: 1 

How many people you hear saying: “I know the verse one day but forget it the next.” **Well you need to review, that’s all**.

.. vspace:: 1 

**6th.** Use the passages of Scripture. Seek occasions for talking to persons who have difficulties. **Practice! Practice!! Practice!!!** That’s what the **lawyer**, **preacher**, and **doctor** have to do, and that is what I had to do. Be “seasonable” or “unseasonable,” in season or out of season, only **seek** your **opportunity** to **practice**.

.. vspace:: 1 

**7th.** Will you join the author in committing to memory the Gospel of St. John in a year?  Learn three verses a day and review constantly until a chapter is repeated at one time?
